    "# Final Random Forest Model for Flask Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the finalized code to build the Random Forest model for the breast cancer prediction web app. It uses the 13 features identified during the feature selection process in `Set3Model.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To train the model on the *entire* dataset and then serialize (save) the trained model object and the data scaler to disk using `joblib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These saved files (`breast_cancer_model.joblib` and `scaler.joblib`) are what the Flask application will load at startup to make predictions on new user input. This separates the model training process (which is done once, here) from the prediction process (which is done by the live app)."
